App Brainstorming

apps that I like:
1. Flora - intuitive user interface, eco theme
2. Telegram - secure and robust functionality
3. Canva - Thank God for its existence, super useful
4. Lensa - beautiful presets for photos
5. Captions - for AI subtitles

   Idea: I'd like to create an app that helps people with finances in Kazakhstan. We don't have programs like Roth IRA, or stock platforms, so people can educate themself in financial literacy
